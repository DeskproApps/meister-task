MeisterTask App Setup Instructions
===

To install the MeisterTask app, you must first create an app with a "Client ID" and "Client Secret". Head over to your MindMeister account to get started.

Once you've logged in, navigate to the creation app page [https://www.mindmeister.com/api](https://www.mindmeister.com/api)

Here you'll see a OAuth 2.0 Apps block, click the button __"Add"__ to create the App.

Give the app name - this can be anything, something like "Deskpro App" will do. And enter your Deskpro URL in the "Redirect URI" field (You can copy this from the MeisterTask settings tab in this admin drawer in Deskpro).

Then click "Submit"

After that, we will see the created app. Copy the "Client ID" and "Client secret" and keep them safe.

Next, head back to Deskpro and enter the Client ID and Secret into the app settings form.

To configure who can see and use the MeisterTask app, head to the "Permissions" tab and select those users and/or groups you'd like to have access.

When you're happy, click "Install".
